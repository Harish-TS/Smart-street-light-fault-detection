The project presents a design for an intelligent street lighting system that incorporates automatic detection of faults that could occur with a Street Light.
The study aims to develop an integrated intelligent street lighting system based on intensity control, ultrasonic sensors for object detection, LDR sensors for measuring light intensity .
The ESP32 microcontroller, with its low-cost, low-power , and Wi-Fi for data storage and monitoring.
By associating RFID tags with specific streetlights, we can track maintenance activities and log relevant information in a centralized database.
The combination of Voltage and LDR sensors enables our system to comprehensively monitor the operational status of streetlights, providing real-time insights into both power supply integrity and lighting functionality.
